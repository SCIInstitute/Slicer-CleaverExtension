Slicer-CleaverExtension
=======================

This extension packages Cleaver, a multimaterial tetrahedral meshing library.

Cleaver is a C++ library for generating guaranteed-quality, tetrahedral meshes
of multimaterial volumetric data. It is based on the 'Lattice Cleaving' algor-
ithm:

Bronson J., Levine, J., Whitaker R., "Lattice Cleaving: Conforming Tetrahedral
Meshes of Multimaterial Domains with Bounded Quality." Proceedings of the 21st
International Meshing Roundtable (San Jose, CA, Oct 7-10, 2012)

The method is theoretically guaranteed to produce valid meshes with bounded
dihedral angles, while still conforming to multimaterial surfaces. Empirically
these bounds have been shown to be significant.
